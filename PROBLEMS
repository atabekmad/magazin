	 * Passwords aren't validated. User is able to enter almost anything including whitespaces and non-latin symbols.

	 * Ordered items can be duplicated in Cart if they are ordered more that one time. In this case it's better to represent each item in the Cart followed by number of purchases.

	 * Make DateTo less that DateFrom
